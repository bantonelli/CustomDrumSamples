What is the Code Doing?
    ng-app attribute represents an Angular directive named ngApp:
        Spinal case for custom attributes
        Camel case for corresponding directives.

    <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js">:
        This code can be put anywhere on the page because it is executed only when the HTML page is fully loaded.
        (However it is still best to put the script tag at the bottom of the page to improve load and render time).
            ********In production DO NOT USE CDN for loading scripts.***********
            There is a callback that looks for the ngApp directive after the page is loaded.
            If angular finds the directive it will bootstrap the application with the root of the application DOM being the
            element with the ng-app attribute.

    {{ expression }}:
        The double curly denotes a binding
        The expression is used inside of a binding
            The binding tells Angular that it should evaluate an expression and insert the result into the DOM in
            place of the binding.
                The binding does this evaluation-insertion process continuously and updates whenever the result of
                the expression changes.

    AngularJS Expression:
        JavaScript-like code snippet that is evaluated by Angular in the context of the current model scope,
        rather than within the scope of the global context (window).



Bootstrapping AngularJS Apps
    ngApp directive:
        Works for most use-cases.
        Advanced cases, such as when using a script loader you can use the manual way to bootstrap the app.
            Example:

            // Call this after you have defined modules--> 'myApp' is the name of the module.
            angular.element(document).ready(function() {
                angular.bootstrap(document, ['myApp']);
            });

    3 Important things that happen during Bootstrap:
        1) The Injector that will be used for dependency injection is created.
        2) The Injector will then create the $rootScope
        3) Angular will then "compile" the DOM starting at the ngApp root element, processing any directives and bindings.

    Once Bootstrapped...:
        1) Angular Waits for incoming browser events (clicks, http responses, etc)
        2) Detects if event propagation caused any changes in the model
        3) If changes found, Angular will update bindings to reflect model changes.


What are all of these files in the working Directory?
    The phonecat app is a pull from the angular-seed project.

    It is the same except for the following:
        1) Removed example app
        2) Added phone images to app/img/phones/
        3) Added phone data files (JSON) to app/phones
        4) Added a dependency on Bootstrap in the bower.json file.
